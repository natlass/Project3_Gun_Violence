# Project 3: Visualization Project Proposal
# Gun Violence Visualization



Sara Edgar, Jessica Johnson, Natalie Lassen, Amanda Vital


We chose the topic of gun violence in America, comparing the number of fatalities due to shootings on the west coast (California), east coast (Pennsylvania), and south (Tennessee). 
The source of our data is:
Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/jameslko/gun-violence-data
We will be using pandas to transform the dataset and put it into a MongoDB. Below is an image of the columns we will keep (highlighted) for our metadata out of the original 29.

We hope to create a combination of the visualizations below for our project. We will use different colored markers to identify the gender of the shooter, and create a legend to offer a choice of years from 2013-2018. Additionally, we will build a pop-up that will display how many people were killed in the incident.
 
 
These are some images we used as inspiration to build the map we aim to make:

This is what we hope our final product to look like (roughly):

Additionally, the map will have a popup feature to list the specific location of the incident, as well as the total number of people killed and/or injured.
